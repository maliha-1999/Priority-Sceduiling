# Priority-Sceduiling
# Priority Scheduling Algorithm

## Overview

This repository provides an illustration of the Priority Scheduling algorithm, a fundamental scheduling technique in operating systems. Priority Scheduling assigns priorities to each process and executes the highest priority process first. This approach ensures that higher priority processes are completed before lower priority ones, potentially enhancing system responsiveness and meeting critical task deadlines.

## Input Details

To simulate the Priority Scheduling algorithm, the user is prompted to input the following for each process:

- **Burst Time:** The amount of CPU time required by each process.
- **Priority:** An integer indicating the priority level of each process, where lower numbers denote higher priorities.



### Example Input
Enter Total Number of Processes: 4

Enter Burst Time and Priority for each process:
P[1]
Burst Time: 7
Priority: 2

P[2]
Burst Time: 4
Priority: 1

P[3]
Burst Time: 1
Priority: 4

P[4]
Burst Time: 5
Priority: 3
